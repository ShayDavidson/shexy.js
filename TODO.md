- Map all vertices and hexes in BFS?
- Fill the gaps when blocking (how many vertices minimum in order to be blocked entirely)
- Find a way to represent vertices in a unique way.
- Pool for coords
- Order and proper, unique terms (i,corner etc).
- Randomlly generated boards.
- Dijkstra optimizations (change to A star? traverse in DFS with direction in mind?)
